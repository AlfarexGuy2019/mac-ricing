# Ricing on macOS (Work In Progress)
This is a GitHub repository where you can find resources and guides to help you rice the Unix-based macOS. 

People say that macOS is the most difficult-to-tweak operating system. Prove them wrong. Here is a Gruvbox setup I've made on macOS Big Sur 11.5.2, using tweaks and resources from the internet.

I'll share information in the form of a FAQ.
Here goes:

**But how do you do all the stuff?**

> I've used a theme for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), a wallpaper from the internet and A BetterDiscord theme called [Duvbox](https://github.com/CircuitRCAY/Duvbox). Other than that, I've used a theme for the Chromium-based Microsoft Edge browser. I recommend using Firefox, Safari and Edge on macOS.

**Wait, how tf did you make the taskbar?**

> I used uBar. duh. Okay so uBar is a dock replacement for macOS, which provides a taskbar and a status bar, combined into a single bar. It provides a gorgeous UI and has a easy-to-use settings pane.
