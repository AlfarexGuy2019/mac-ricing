# Ricing on macOS (Work In Progress)
This is a GitHub repository where you can find resources and guides to help you rice the Unix-based macOS. 

People say that macOS is the most difficult-to-tweak operating system. Prove them wrong. Here is a Gruvbox setup I've made on macOS Big Sur 11.5.2, using tweaks and resources from the internet.

I'll share information in the form of a FAQ.
Here goes:

**But how do you do all the stuff?**

> I've used a theme for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), a wallpaper from the internet and A BetterDiscord theme called [Duvbox](https://github.com/CircuitRCAY/Duvbox). Other than that, I've used a theme for the Chromium-based Microsoft Edge browser. I recommend using Firefox, Safari and Edge on macOS.

**Wait, how tf did you make the taskbar?**

> I used uBar. duh. Okay so uBar is a dock replacement for macOS, which provides a taskbar and a status bar, combined into a single bar. It provides a gorgeous UI and has a easy-to-use settings pane.


Lets get into the actual stuff!

- 1. System UX

> System UX isn't tweakable, but still we have a few apps which allow you to activate a few secret features. I recommend using [TinkerTool](https://www.bresink.com/osx/TinkerTool.html), since it is more popular, and is tursted by many.

- 2. Dock Icons

> Ah yes, this is cool. So, you can actually use [MacTheme Installer](https://macthemes.co) to install custom dock icon packs.

- 3. The Finderbar.

> Just use BarTender, its the best app for customizing your Finderbar. NO CAP.
